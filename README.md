# L4-library

Welcome to the [L4](l4v.io) Library, a collection of online and offline material that reflects the interests and learning resources of L4 and its companies.

The first several sections are organized by topic. The links in each section are what we consider essential reading. The last section of the library is a list of physical materials available in the L4 offices in Toronto, which cover many diverse topics. This physical library grows as we grow: every new person to join the L4 team chooses a book to add. 

This list is updated frequently.
